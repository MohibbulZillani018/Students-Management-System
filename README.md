## Student Management System
A Student Management System (SMS) built with Java to showcase fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This project demonstrates clean object-oriented programming principles, such as encapsulation, and provides a user-friendly interface for managing student information.

## Key Features
 Model Layer: A Student class to represent each student's attributes, such as ID, name, email, gender, and more.

Controller Layer: A StudentController class that handles business logic and CRUD operations using an ArrayList.

View Layer: A Studentview class to interact with users through a menu-driven interface, allowing actions like:

> Adding a new student

> Viewing all students

> Finding a student by ID

> Updating a student's information

> Deleting a student by ID

## Functionality
Users can input student details dynamically through a console-based interface.

## Supports robust operations like:

> Adding new records.

> Searching for a student by their unique ID.

> Updating student data securely.

> Deleting records efficiently.
